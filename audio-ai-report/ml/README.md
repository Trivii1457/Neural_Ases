# Machine Learning Module Documentation

This module is responsible for handling all machine learning-related tasks in the Audio AI Report project. It includes functionalities for loading models, performing inference, and training models on audio data.

## Structure

- `__init__.py`: Initializes the machine learning module.
- `model_loader.py`: Contains functions to load pre-trained machine learning models.
- `inference.py`: Handles the inference process using the loaded models.
- `training/`: Directory containing training-related files.
  - `__init__.py`: Initializes the training module.
  - `dataset.py`: Manages the loading and preprocessing of training datasets.
  - `train.py`: Contains the logic for training machine learning models.

## Usage

1. **Model Loading**: Use `model_loader.py` to load your pre-trained models.
2. **Inference**: Utilize `inference.py` to make predictions on new audio data.
3. **Training**: Use the files in the `training` directory to train new models on your datasets.

## Requirements

Ensure that you have the necessary dependencies installed as specified in the `requirements.txt` file in the backend directory.
