# This file contains information about the database migrations for the audio AI report project.

# Migrations are essential for managing changes to the database schema over time.
# They allow for version control of the database structure, making it easier to apply updates,
# roll back changes, and maintain consistency across different environments.

# This directory will contain migration scripts that define the changes to be applied to the database.
# Each migration script should be named in a way that reflects its purpose and the order in which it should be applied.

# To create a new migration, use the appropriate migration tool or framework that is integrated with the project.
# Ensure to document each migration clearly, including the changes made and the reason for those changes.

# It is recommended to run migrations in a development environment before applying them to production to avoid potential issues.
